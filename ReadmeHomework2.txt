1. There are two python files:
  1) homework2_rent.py (with following two functions):
    * score_rent
    * predict_rent

  2) test_rent.py (with a function of "test_rent" to check the R^2 returned by the score_rent)

2. Modelling
   This is a Linear Regression modle

3. Model validation
   This model could be validated by using R^2,which shows the goodness of fit of the mode between real value and predicated value.
